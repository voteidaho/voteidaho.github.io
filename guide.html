            <h1>A Quick Guide to Voting in the 2018 Midterm Elections</h1>

    <div class="desc">
        <h2>Premise: Why Vote?</h2>
        <p class="p">Voting is the best way to voice your opinions on issues affecting today. This guide is specifically catering towards younger people (in the Gen Z and Millenial age groups) considering that they are newer to the voting process than their older counterparts. <br><br>
		Young voters are actually more important to the total electorate than you think. Did you know that people ages 18-35 count for more than 34% of the electorate? <br><br>
		Young people also bring forth new ideas to discuss and vote upon to help progress society. It is actually bad to not be educated and vote, as democracy only works with a collection of unique ideas to allow for diversity. </p>
        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p class="p">Education, first and foremost, is the most important step to successfully voting. Be sure to read up online from multiple sources about candidates and issues that are up for grabs. <a href="https://news.google.com/?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en" style="color: #FE9800;">Google news</a> is a good place to start. They showcase a variety of articles, updated by the hour.<br><br> Next up is the voting registration. There are three ways to register to vote: filling out a voter registration form at your county's DMV, by mail, which is the National Registration form, or online, which can be accessed at the link at the top right of this webpage.</p>
        <h2>Voting Requirements</h2>
        <p class="p">There are three requirements to be an eligible member of the electorate. You must be 18 years of age, you must be an American citizen, and you can not have a felony or greater on your criminal record.</p>
		<h2>Let's Vote</h2>
		<p class="p">At least in the state of Idaho, there are specific rules for voting explicitly in your precinct. To locate the precinct designated to your home address and if you live in Ada County, click <a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/elections/Voter-Information/Find-My-Polling-Place" style="color: #FE9800;">here</a>. You can also vote by mail and in Idaho you can participate in early voting at your precinct. <br><br>Election day is November 6, 2018, and when you show up, you must bring a form of photo identification. Items eligible to prove your identity are the following: Idaho driver's license, Idaho Photo ID card, US Passport or federal photo ID card, or a tribal photo ID. Additional state-funded identifications work as well, such as: concealed weapons permits, and any ID cards handed out from Idaho high schools, colleges, or technical schools.</p>
		<h2>Good Luck!</h2>
		<p class="p">Good luck to the candidates and propositions you select this voting season cycle! You are helping society by offering your opinions and getting the right people elected.</p>
